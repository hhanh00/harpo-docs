> I’m reaching out because I’d like to strongly encourage you to submit a grant proposal to cover ongoing development and maintenance of Ywallet.  I will support your proposal and do my best to get the other committee members to support and approve it as well. Many of them have already commented on what a great wallet Ywallet is.  

Thanks for reaching out. There are a few reasons why I don't plan to submit a grant proposal, even though I have done so in the past for other projects.

I find the grant system deeply flawed at the moment. Worse, the situation is getting worse.

## Wallet & Grants

- ZecWallet, NightHawk have combined grants exceeding 1 million USD. Yet, it is clear that they work only
in ideal conditions and fail otherwise,
  - ZW failed to place 1000 transactions during the NFT offering because there was a surge in traffic at the time,
  - ZW & NH cannot cope with the current tx usage. 
  - I understand that software is not perfect and at the time they were built, there was no need for scale. After all,
  zcashd & lightwalletd are also facing performance issues
- But, and my point is this, I have mentioned these performance issues to the community in the forums long ago. I have
explained how BlazeSync wouldn't scale by design. Same thing for NH.
The reception from the authors was swift: This is defamation. Most of the community sided with them over performance numbers
and facts.
- After that, the ECC continued to praise ZW and NH. And ZCG continued to fund them. 

## Tech Grants

Slightly discouraged, I still tried to contribute to zcash. I have submitted 2 tech grants that would have improved the value of zcash.
- Hardware acceleration of trial decryptions. This would have greatly accelerated the synchronization. Currently, 
note trial decryption accounts for 90% of the time in WARP SYNC. It's less % wise for other wallets but it is because
they are less optimized and spend too much time on other tasks.
- FROST. ZF said they would have it out during the summer. They didn't. In the meantime, an implementation came out
for Monero. 

In conclusion,
> It's clear to me that the whole grant process is a popularity contest with backing from ECC and ZF.

Now speaking of grants, there are two kinds of grants that would make sense for Ywallet:
- Maintenance
- Retroactive

A maintenance grant would be paltry compared to the value delivered by YWallet. Moreover, it would be
entail some commitment on my part to work with the very people I disagree with.
I think you see that this is not attractive to me.

A retroactive grant would follow the model that Zookoo suggested: Deliver quality first and be rewarded later.
I don't believe this is what you have in mind.

In answer to:
> The biggest criticism I hear about Ywallet is that it’s called Ywallet. People are not aware it’s a multi-currency wallet that supports both Ycash and Zcash. One reason for that is Ywallet uses the former official Ycash logo. I think it would be great if Ywallet was currency agnostic. One idea I had was to re-name the wallet to "Warp Wallet" and advertise it as something like "a privacy-oriented multi-currency wallet for both Ycash and Zcash”. You may have reasons for not wanting to change the name, and I understand that. Is there anything you can do to address this issue? 

First, YWallet is advertised as "YWallet is a privacy oriented wallet and messenger for Ycash and Zcash". It's on the front page of the website.

Second, I don't care what these people think about YWallet. I am not after getting users. What for? Exposure?
If I was, I would have worked with the ECC people to ensure that YWallet gets listed on z.cash. I have played the corporate game long enough to know how to lobby.

YWallet was born entirely out of necessity. I wanted a wallet that worked. Initially, I tried to convince Aditya to implement WarpSync but
he was keen on doing BlazeSync. Therefore I prototyped zcash-sync and it eventually became YWallet. At the moment, I am helping some users get their funds
out of ZWL because I don't think they should be the victims. They have locked funds and the wallet authors are not ignoring them. I think this is highly unprofessional
but typical of the grant mentality: Deliver a product, get the grant money and forget about the users. They are in for the cash but not for zcash.

If zcash users cannot find YWallet, I am sorry but it is mostly because they have the preconception that YWallet = Ycash. I agree that there was some
clear association. The logo is the Ycash logo and the first wallet *was* a Ycash wallet. The first wallet is no longer Ycash. And maybe someday the logo/name
will change.

But it won't change because zcash users cannot find it. I am proud of the history of Ywallet and grateful to the Ycash community
for working with me to make YWallet better. Especially when the Zcash community response was for the most part to *ignore it* and pretend it doesn't exist.

> Is there anything you can do to address this issue? 

I don't see an issue. Frankly, your suggestion seems to be an attempt at appropriation.

Best regards,
