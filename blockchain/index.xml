Ideally, every block would be neatly lined up and form a single linked list.
Block A block has the following properties:
a hash value that serves as its unique identifier. Hash values are considered unique as long as they refer to different content a reference to the previous block as a field prev_hash These two values are enough for linking the blocks.</description></item><item><title>Game</title><link>https://harpocoin.xyz/blockchain/game/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 05:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harpocoin.xyz/blockchain/game/</guid><description>In this game, we receive blocks one by one. Our goal is to determine if the block is valid and if yes, where it should be placed in the &amp;ldquo;blockchain tree&amp;rdquo;. The bonus goal is to keep track of the longest chain, i.e. the main chain.
Branch and chain are used interchangeably here.
A branch is the series of blocks going from a leaf (a block that has no follower) to the first block</description></item></channel></rss>
